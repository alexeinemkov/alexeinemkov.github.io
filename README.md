A variant of fixed single-track routing for modeling traffic distribution in a Mesh network is presented. The developed model allows you to analyze the routing operation in various network variants entered by the user. When solving the flow distribution problem, a self â€“ similar process is used as a traffic model-fractal Brownian motion (fBM/D/1) characterized by a Hearst coefficient.
